    <div class="content">
        <h2>Content Section 1</h2>
        <p>This content scrolls normally. As you scroll down, you'll see the background image in the section above appears to stay still, creating a sense of depth. This is the parallax effect in action. Keep scrolling to see more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="parallax">
        <h2>Another one!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Content Section 2</h2>
        <p>The effect can be used multiple times on a page to separate different sections visually. The key is the fixed background, which peeks through behind the normal scrolling content.</p>
